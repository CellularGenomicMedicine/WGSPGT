Sequencing output is processed via the following steps (scripts not included here)

1. Demultiplexing
2. FASTQC
3. Alignment using BWA-MEM2
4. BAMQC
5. GATK Joint-genotyping using GATK4
6. Family-wise batches (i.e. multisample vcf files) are generated using gatk-haplotype-joint calling. The resulting vcf file was analysed by Haplarithmisis.
7. GATK4 from Broad Institute is available at gatk.broadinstitute.org.
